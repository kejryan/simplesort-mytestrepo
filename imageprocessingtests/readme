run python3 imageProcessing.py, you should see a window appear that gives you live video from the camera. Press any key to take a picture, this window should disapper (or freeze) then the terminal will print the category, then whether it is trash, compost, recycle and what gpio has been set.
This program runs very slowly so don't abort if it takes a minute after a key press
gpio:
 4 -> recycle, 5 -> compost, -> 4 & 5 -> trash
motionDetectTest.py is still a work in progress, but ideally it should detect whether trash has been placed in front of the camera or not. Going forward this should replace the keyboard input input in imageProcessing.py
when running python3 motionDetectTest.py the terminal will print either "motion detected" or "motion not detected" once a second if there is a change to what the camera is pointing at.
